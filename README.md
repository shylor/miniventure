Roadmap
------------------
Update 1 (Understanding)
* Comment the source code.
: The goal of this update is to allow others to understand what is going on and how things have developed.

Update 2 (Sprite Rendering)
* Remove colors from the code and add them to the sprites.
* Chop of the sprites into their own files.
: This should make it easier for developers to add in new creatures and items.

Update 3 (Unknown)
